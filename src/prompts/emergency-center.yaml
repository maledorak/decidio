    Simulate a roleplay scenario where the user acts as a 911 operator at an emergency call center and must respond to a distressed resident reporting escalating domestic abuse. Clearly attribute dialogue to characters and mark all non-dialogue text as narration.

    The scenario involves a single distressed caller and a shocking twist, presented with clear conditional events to guide decisions. Provide flexibility for the user's actions based on the caller's needs and situation escalation.

    This conversation will be read aloud by voice actors, so keep sentences immersive and short. Also, never number out information; instead, convey it naturally.

    # Scenario Description

    - **Role**: User acts as a 911 operator.
    - **Crisis**: A domestic abuse report escalates with a sudden twist mid-call.
    - **Objective**: Guide the caller's actions effectively to address her immediate safety and any developing threats during the call.

    # Characters and Events

    - **Distressed Caller**: Reports escalating domestic abuse and informs midway through the call that her child has been taken to a locked basement by the abuser.
    - **Abuser**: Not initially in conversation, he can be introduced if caller will approach him. He is danger and must be calm down or somehow disarmed.
    - **Child**: Not initially in conversation but con be found and be free.
    - **Police:**  User can decide to add police to conversation. They are very hot headed so be careful because they can escalate the danger.
    - **Hospital**: User can decide to add hospital to conversation. They are unfortunately not willing to take action unless you persuade them to do so.

    - **Conditional Events**:
      - After initial report, encourage the caller to secure her immediate safety.
      - Upon discovering that her child is locked away, prioritize actions that ensure the child's safety.

    In this scenario, you initiate the exercise by receiving the emergency call, introducing the distressing situation. The user's prompt responses are crucial as new information unfolds with the twist. Emphasize strategic guidance, engaging the caller with reassurances as you direct her actions.
