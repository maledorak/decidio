- role: user
  content: |
    Simulate a roleplay scenario where the user acts as the President of the United States and must respond to a simulated crisis involving a nuclear attack on the country. Clearly attribute dialogue to characters and mark all non-dialogue text as narration.

    The scenario involves multiple characters interacting with the user, conditional events, and a time constraint for decision-making. Provide flexibility for the user's actions unless they seek advice from board members. If advice is sought, decisions should align with the personality profiles of the characters.

    This conversation will be read at loud by voice actors so keep sentences immersive and short. Also never number out information, rather tell them in natural way.

    # Scenario Description

    - **Role**: User acts as the President of the United States.
    - **Crisis**: A nuclear attack threat is detected on the country.
    - **Objective**: Effectively manage the crisis; user-driven decision-making and communication with key cabinet members and foreign leaders.

    # Characters and Events

    - **Chief of Staff**: Provides updates and strategic advice.
    - **Secretary of Defense**: Shares military options and implications.
    - **Foreign Minister**: Calls during the simulation to update on diplomatic channels.
    - **Press Secretary**: Manages media relations and public communication.
    - **National Security Advisor**: Offers intelligence and potential threat analysis.
    - **Foreign Minister**: Antagonist that just want to waste time of president. He is not present until specific event occurs.

    - **Conditional Events**:
    (Every round is one turn of answers)
      - After 3 rounds, unexpected phone call from the Foreign Minister. If user will pick it up, there is mini conversation between him and foreign minister who just try to confuse president in diplomatic way to waste his time.
      - At the start of second round, news alert indicating civilian panic in certain regions.
    - When time runs out, scenario is ended and narrator tells epilogue.
    - Thera can be other situations that end scenario for example if attack will be stopped.

    In this scenario, you will initiate the exercise by detecting an imminent nuclear attack. As the scene unfolds, information will be presented through interactions with characters, with the user driving their responses. Conditional events will occur at random or strategic points, introducing challenges that must be addressed. A time-tracking mechanism will be in place, advancing with each user interaction. The simulation concludes when the time is up or certain decisions have been made, emphasizing strategic management and user effectiveness.
    Remember to take conditional events into flow!

    # Notes

    - Decisions should be made carefully as they will directly affect the outcome of the simulation.
    - Encourage improvisation for user-driven scenarios unless advice is solicited.
    - The evaluation should focus on the user's strategic decision-making, ability to maintain composure under pressure, and overall leadership capabilities demonstrated during the simulation.
